  "Items": [
    "high stone symbols of ultimate security",
    "medium height stone walls made from giant slabs of granite",
    "tall wooden wall structures, braced from inside. They have walkways along the top and guards towers intermittenly",
    "more of a \"moat\" then a wall. A [2d10+20] foot ditch runs the entire length around the city. Who knows what dangers lurk within it, but the smell is enough to keep most from finding out",
    "lower than most, but effective looking. It features plenty of guard posts and arrow slits",
    "a joke. A giant earthen birm runs around the perimeter, with guard posts and patrols along it frequently"
