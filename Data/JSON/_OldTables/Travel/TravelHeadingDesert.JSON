    "before a gravel-floored valley littered with jagged obsidian boulders.",
    "to the foot of a solitary, enormous sand dune that?s as big as any mountain you?ve ever seen.",
    "toward a valley dominated by a yucca tree forest.",
    "into a giant basin of fine, deep sand. A windstorm here would be a deadly affair.",
    "on toward a vast expanse of rippled sand, which as far as you can tell from here is barren of life or landmark.",
    "toward rocky foothills dwarfed by the lumbering sand dunes behind them.",
    "toward a flat, stone-covered plain that has been dominated by wind erosion for millennia.",
    "along the bottom of a deep canyon, with deep shadows and steep walls.",
    "into a massive dry riverbed, with steep sides and a gravel bottom.",
    "toward a towering Mesa that?s casting deep shadows across the land.",
    "toward a massive dry lakebed, devoid of vegetation or shelter.",
    "toward a dune sea today, with massive shifting dunes stretching onward to the horizon.",
    "to the edge of a massive cliff, overlooking the desert below.",
    "into a petrified forest thick with ominous, leafless stone trees.",
    "into a seemingly endless salt flat.",
    "toward low, rolling borax hills that are painted in many different vibrant desert hues.",
    "into the craggy remains of some ancient siezmic event which seems to have thrust jagged bedrock that now reaches high into the air.",
    "through a valley teeming with desert life and vibrant cactus flowers.",
    "atop a ridge, where you can see for miles around in every direction.",
    "through a dry lakebed seemingly plagued by random sinkholes."
