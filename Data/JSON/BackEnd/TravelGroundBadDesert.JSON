                  "fissures and shallow ravines criss-cross in your way, making for tiresome and time-consuming obstacles",

                  "the exposed bedrock looks almost like sun-bleached bones, jutting our of the landscape at odd angles",
                  "erosion has destroyed all traces of any other typical routes",
                  "thorned tumbleweeds complicate the issue as they bash about",
                  "the deep sands belabor every step",
                  "the loose gravel is tiresome to trudge through",
                  "as if that wasn?t bad enough, a canyon you weren?t expecting runs across your direction of travel",
                  "giant sun-baked boulders are constantly in the way",
                  "the area is absolutely choked with menacing cacti",
                  "there are large dry riverbeds in the way with steep, cliff-like sides",
                  "large sand dunes periodically block your path",
                  "the rocky ground strewn with boulders adds to the difficulty",
                  "the shifting sand makes it twice as frustrating",
                  "what seemed like solid, cracked mud on the ground at first turned out to be only a dried layer atop actual, terribly thick mud",
                  "impossibly deep pea gravel exhausts every effort to traverse it- as every step sinks into the pebbles nearly a foot deep",
                  "making matters worse, the ground is absolutely infested with thorn-riddled picker bushes here",
                  "the white sand covering the ground in this area is nearly blinding as it reflects the light from above",
                  "this area is rife with ruts crisscrossing the landscape, some as high as a halfling is tall",
                  "the whole area is comprised of a shifting sea of sand, that no doubt harbors dangerous quicksand pools lying in wait for the unlucky traveller"
