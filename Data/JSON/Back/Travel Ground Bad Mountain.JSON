The king has received an anonymous kidnapping threat.","It is revealed that due to a mistake in the royal records, the king?s twin brother (who they thought was 10 minutes younger) is actually 10 minutes older than the king.","The human king and queen are having a baby. The queen gives birth to a half-elf.","The king is an only child and finds out that he cannot have children. There is no clear heir.","The Queen (who is loved by the people) has publicly announced that she wants a divorce, but royal divorce is illegal.","The prince?s cat dies and he demands a full funeral. The king didn?t even know the cat existed.","There is a book that automatically writes the name of every future great king or queen when they are born. The book hasn?t written any of the princes or princesses names and the king is on his deathbed.","One of the siblings has fallen in love with the eldest?s fiance.","All but one of the royal family has come down with a fatal disease.","A witch has cursed the children to only speak the truth and they?ve all been mute for weeks to guard a horrible secret.","It?s been discovered one member of the royal family has dyed their hair all their lives to hide the true color.","A fierce debate over who owns the kittens of the family cat has erupted shortly before one family member is due to move away forever.","The middle child?s dormant sorcery has finally awakened.","The king?s exotic pet is becoming troublesome to take care of, but he refuses to part with it.","Two royal siblings are incestuous, and everybody knows it. Possible twist: they?re not.","The tapestries in the palace are forgeries; the previous king pawned them all off, and the current one couldn?t find them, so they had to be replaced with replicas. Possible twist: the actual tapestries are hidden somewhere on the castle grounds, and the royal family would be grateful if they were retrieved.","Count Doogeston?s mother was a horse. Possible twist: his mother was an actual horse.","The peacocks in the youngest prince?s bedroom are his harem, kept transfigured by some odd magic. Possible twist: he just likes peacocks.","The prince, in a fit of anger, leaves the kingdom, only coming back to find the king has died and an imposter is claiming the crown at the same time as the prince does!","A shapeshifter has infiltrated the palace, taking the form and nature of objects, livestock, and inhabitants, and is out to backstab the royal family. It is suspected that he dumps all his victims into the river, so he can take the form of secretly deceased servants. The only way to identify him is that he coughs up blood.","A demon-possessed (undead, looking the same as when he was tombed) body of a former king arises when the kingship is to be passed to his younger brother. This body is that of the new king?s dead father. Not sure whether the king is himself, an imposter, or ? Heaven forbid ? demonic undead, he is requesting all manner of people (religious, educated, business, peasant, fighter, doctor, and so forth) to come and look at him.","The prince is found out to be insane at the age of a young adult, calling every flower ?his princess? and demanding a funeral every time one dies. If anyone makes the horrid mistake of picking at least one in the royal gardens, then the strolling prince takes one of the many swords hanging on the wall charges at the cast, intent on killing everyone (killing every sentient and non-sentient member, except those plant races who have flowers on them).","The court wizard and the heir apparent are involved in a blossoming relationship and everybody else is more than a little uncomfortable with it (wizard is pushing a century, maybe unnaturally long-lived, heir is early 30s).","The queen is sick of all her spoiled children and is eager to disown them all and adopt someone else as heir. She hands out a mildly-dangerous quest to retrieve a family heirloom, and when the adventurers bring it back she tries to make one of them the crown princess/prince.","Rumor has it that the king went gray years ago, but he keeps dyeing his hair.","Several of the court?s mid-tier advisers are in a polyamorous relationship. They enact complicated (but benign) plans to hide this, but everyone in court already knows ? they just don?t care. (Possible complication: a deception becomes not-fully-benign and someone gets hurt or dishonored)","The royal family seems like a hot mess from the outside, but they?re all faking it to hide the true extent of their power and influence. (Could be for benevolent national-security reasons or malevolent, oppressive reasons.)","The crown prince finally had his coming-of-age birthday party, and the Queen was going to abdicate as is custom, but the prince suffered some great dishonor at the party. The nation?s customs dictate that he must resolve the slight against him before the Queen can pass her crown to him.","Rumour has it that the king has gone mad, and that the queen is running the kingdom.","A Lady of the court was seen fraternising with the prince, and is now with child. The king wants her killed, but the queen wants the prince to marry her before the baby is due.","Apparently the Duke has been spotted fornicating with the Queen, and his enemies are blackmailing them both.","The king has died, and the heir and only remaining member of his ?family? is his former queen?s illegitimate half-orc son, who has no idea who his stepfather is.","The king has been captivated by a Rasputin-like advisor who has a chicken he claims is oracular. The advisor has persuaded the king to carve a great mandala of arcane symbols on the throne room floor: wherever the chicken sits determines the king?s decisions. Thing is, the kingdom is having a great run ever since the chicken came along.","The new court chef sold his soul to an agent of an archdevil of the Nine Hells who has now come to collect his fee. Only by poisoning the royal family can he delay his doom and continue to enjoy the fruits of the material plane.","The prince fell in love with a lady of a rival noble family, the king is furious until he dies of natural causes. The prince takes his place on the throne but the new queen is really calling all the shots. She begins putting her family in power until the prince finds out that his father didn?t die of old age, he was poisoned.","The king has two children that are both equally qualified to take over his throne. One would use the throne for good and is upstanding, but wishes to become a travelling bard. The other wants to send the country to war and is a real jerk.","The king, against his family?s wishes, marries a peasant girl who appeared to him as sweet and pleasant. In reality she is hugely manipulative, a puppet master who manages to rule everything through him. It only gets easier as the king?s mentality deteriates with age, and its up to his family members to expose her actions.","A female noble follows through an arranged marriage to successfully form an alliance. Her brother, the heir, and her husband, the heir of the other kingdom, are not only head over heels for each other, but also completely useless as rulers. So now she must not only help cover up their affair, but manage two lands on her own.","Everyone wanted great aunt Hilda?s stuff upon her death. She however felt none were worthy with their corruption and greed, so she turns to immortalizing herself until the family finally produces a worthy heir.","The heir to the kingdom has chosen to abandon his inheritance and live a life of piety. The head of house has convinced him to take a year to reconsider and make the correct decision.","The lady of the house is known to have fits and visions. What is not common knowledge is that they have stopped since an attractive young priest has come to town.","A nearby citie\u0027s head of house was sent to this area as a ploy to prevent him from siezing the throne ahead of the rightful heir. He?s furious and taking it out on the smallfolk.","The child of the family keeps throwing away his expensive toys, much to the parents dismay. Their latest attempt is a warforged marionette to entertain him. He didn?t want them either.","The royals have been getting incredibly sick lately, and nobody knows why. Each one of them has a different illness.","The former queen, the current queen?s mother, has passed away. Her will is incredibly bizarre.","All the royal guards quit at the exact same time.","The family is trying to get their portrait painted, but they?re so picky that nobody has been successful in meeting their standards.","The prince is going bald and is doing his best to hide it. He?s not doing a good job.","The princess is going through the dreaded ?terrible twos?.","Somebody vandalized the palace, and now the king is personally seeking revenge. He?s far too old for this.","Good news, a new baby is on the way! Bad news, nobody knows who the father is.","The [Royal Family Member] wants a taste of peasant life.","The King and Queen are utterly corrupt and the prince knows he?s the only one who can save the kingdom. The only problem is, he was never properly educated or trained and is completely inept.","The Queen has a soft spot for small yappy dogs. She collects them and the Royal household is overflowing with the beasts. They bark incessantly, bite everyone, and the maids are nearly ready to quit due to all the extra cleaning necessary. In addition, the whole palace seems to smell like urine.","The Queen is a budding horticulturist and spends a lot of time gardening and trying to breed new fruits or other crops. An entire section of the Parade grounds has been turned into a vegetable garden, and the royal flower gardens are now a small orchard. The rest of the House Hold feels as though that is beneath their dignity and would love to have the Royal Gardens under the care of a ?proper? gardener and the Captain of the Royal Guard wants ?his? courtyard back.","The Princes Royal have harbored a grudge ever since they were toddlers and are always fighting. Stemming from a time when the elder brother struck the younger over the head with a wooden soldier he was playing with, they disagree on everything. The King is aging, and many wonder if the Princes will also fight over the succession\u0085","Someone in the royal household has been discretely stealing food from the Royal Larder. The Head of the Royal Staff is looking intently, but has found no evidence it was any of his staff. Secretly one of the Royal Children has been giving food to the poor late at night hoping no one would notice a few missing items.","The King and Queen are both from rival houses that married to settle unrest in the Kingdom. Fortunately, they have grown fond of each other and are truly willing to let the past be the past. However their plethora of uncles, aunts, nephews, and nieces are not. It seems that early every day someone must bring up a wrong done to them in the past and seeks righting of said wrong. These petty complaints range from a hundred year old duel to the death all the way who has the rights to next weekend?s retreat in the hunting lodge (it?s really just a shack in the woods and no one really likes it, but it?s the principal of the thing).","The Queen Mother (current King?s mother) threw a party for her favored courtiers and the young princes not only refused to show up, but also insulted her parties calling them ?dry, boring, and serves terrible tea?. Many monocles were popped and many ruffs ruffled. Now the Queen Mother is lodged in her rooms and won?t come out and the young Princes are being forced to stand in the hallways holding buckets of tea at arm?s length. Everyone is in a foul mood and the servants are stepping lightly.","A noble family in a bunch of debt marries off their daughter, the dowry serving as a last resort to pay debts. Not long before marriage, the daughter?s face is disfigured on a horrible accident, and the groom to be calls the wedding off.","The [Royal Family Prince or Princess] is being forced into an arranged marriage, but they are gay.","There?s been a number of rebellions that have risen up recently, little does anyone know that it?s in fact the current monarch that?s been funding them, as he doesn\u0027t want to be King anymore. The Monarch has been funding the rebels in exchange for allowing them to live a simple life after the rebellion has succeeded.","Traditionally, the heir to the throne is the current monarch?s eldest child, however the current monarch decides that they want another one of their children to become heir, instead of their eldest. The family and their advisors are split as to whether they are allowed to do this.","In a night of drunken commoner-style revelry, the prince gambled away the crown jewels at a village tavern. All he can remember about the jewels? new owner is that they were merely traveling through the kingdom and would be gone by daybreak. With each passing day, the chance of recovering the jewels lessens\u0085","The original royal family was lost at sea. The dead king?s younger brother and wife find themselves and their children as the sudden and unexpected new royal family.","The queen has gone mad with grief. Each year she selects a new child from among the townsfolk to live a prince\u0027s life, in place of her long lost son.","The king refuses to stop starting wars. It?s like he never wants to hangout around his family and court.","The current king sits on a precarious throne, having usurped it from his predecessor in a coup. He now lives in paranoia that the same fate will befall him.","The daughter of the king has completed a rite of passage to earn the throne after his passing, but the eldest son has not returned from journey abroad, or even heard the news of the kings passing. His looming return casts an ominous shadow over the new, possibly temporary queen.","To the people, it is clear that the king has no power and has been puppeteered by his council. These council members are routinely found guilty of corruption and mismanagement and tried by the people?sometimes even executed. In reality, the council holds no true power, and the king rules through his close relation to the commander of the guard. He purposefully blames the council so the people do not suspect or overthrow him.","The king is in fact no true king, however only a man so delusional that he walked right in and proclaimed himself as such. The people, being too polite, have not bothered to correct him and allow him to parade about town. No one seems willing to break the joke to the party.","The previous monarch died and left no direct heir?instead, only four rival houses each loosely related to the royal bloodline vie for power. The regency council has been too distracted to choose a true successor, for it fears the retaliation of the others if it sides with any individual.","The king believes in the justice of chance above all else. Whenever he is told of a crime, he demands that the criminal is tried in an elaborate gauntlet that effectively boils down to a coin toss?are they innocent and let free, or are they guilty and punishable by death? The people vary in their agreement with this; some will falsely report enemies in the hopes of killing them, while others refuse to report any crimes as to not carry that burden on their backs.","Having suffered a terrible accident in battle, the king has been mutilated beyond human recognition. He threatens any who dare to mention his deformity with execution but refuses to cover it.","The current king isn?t a king at all, he?s a very good lookalike who has been forced into this situation when the old King disappeared.","Two neighbouring kingdoms frequently use commoners in a giant game of chess and the people are becoming sick of it.","A special flower used in the anniversary of the Queen no longer grows and the date is coming up soon. The court haven?t told the King yet and they fear what will happen if there aren?t any of these flowers at the celebration.","The Queen is unable to bear children, a surrogate must be found but also the Queen must look as though she is pregnant to keep up appearances.","The Queen has not been seen in weeks and the King is adamant that she is ?working hard on her work?.. It is suspected that he has killed and eaten her to gain power through some ritual.","The Prince did something and thought he got away with it but believes his sister may have seen it. He needs someone to read her diary to see if she knows what he did. There can be no witnesses.","The second Prince?s firstborn is a bastard, legitimized the day before the first Prince and his heirs all die in one day.","The current King is toying with the idea of Democracy, his heirs are divided on this issue.","The Queen has been captured by the ruler of a nearby kingdom. For the eighth time this year.","The princess has been captured by an evil [Violent Race Single], and they have fallen in love.","The king is actually an impostor who has been effectively hiding who he is.","An evil usurper took the throne and killed all the heirs except a baby who was valiantly rescued \u0085 now that heir is gathering an army to take back the throne. Except, it turns out the baby actually was killed, and a random child was substituted to give the resistance legitimacy.","The old king died without living children. There are a couple of reasonable claimants, and they could really use a lost [Campaign Item 2] to cement their claims \u0085 but when the party finds it, it\u0027s in the possession of a petrified (and thus revivable) better, more-legitimate claimant.","The king?s older brother turned down the throne and disappeared into a life of adventuring. Now with the king in ailing health, a young adventurer approaches claiming to be the child of the older brother and rightful heir to the throne. The king?s offspring are worried about this outsider taking their kingdom from them.","There are rumors that the king?s oldest son isn?t his. The queen had become pregnant surprisingly soon after being rescued from a rival kingdom/ barbarians. The king had never questioned it, having raised him as his own. However, rumors continued to be spread among the kingdom. The other princes see this as an opportunity to bring doubt to his claim as heir to the throne.","The Princess is a fashion trendsetter! She accomplishes this by having everyone else that tries to oppose who fashion trends assasinated.","The Queen has undergone a sudden and dramatic personality shift. She has ordered the execution of her youngest daughter, and the King seems to suddenly be too scared of her to interfere.","Rumors of the Virgin Queen being pregnant has been confirmed by the presence of a new swaddling in the court.

The citizens will turn overly protective when anyone seems overly interested in the child.","An odd quirk of displacement magic shifts the shops locations in town at random at dawn, causing the citizens to build all buildings exactly the same to be able to house all the different shop requirements.

Burn them, burn them all!","Unusually quite a few of the citizens are blind in one eye or both. No one dares to talk about it. They are also afraid of chickens. The settlement is secretly governed by an awakened chicken and her brood. Justice is harsh, anyone caught stepping out of line has an eye pecked out.","This settlement is just an ordinary settlement. Ashamed of their ordinariness, the citizens cover up this self imposed secret by acting towards outsiders in a variety of vaguely sinister and menacing ways.","An extraplanar outsider (angel, demon, or another powerful entity) sleeps under the settlement.

Visiting travelers leave notes stuck in the cracks near various places with a bit of information about that area.","A taxidermy Beholder hangs from the ceiling in the center of this tavern. It?s not a real Beholder. It was made out of leather and paint, but it?s up high enough that no one can get a close look.","The Bartender and serving girls all wear bright green and gold floral sashes over their left shoulders, draped across and tied at the right hip. \u003ci\u003eA few patrons wearing similar sashes drink for free.\u003c/i\u003e","Dozens of floating orbs of light, the size of goose eggs, drift lazily around the tavern, giving off plenty of illumination - \u003ci\u003eto avoid dark corners and sinister plotting.\u003c/i\u003e","Benches mounted to the walls assure that every patron has a protected back. There are no stools or seats at the bar. \u003ci\u003eNo one will be getting backstabbed at this establishment.\u003c/i\u003e","Knee high platforms crisscross the tavern floor so that the Halfling servers can easily fill mugs and clear tables. It does make for a tripping hazard for tall folk, so watch yer step. \u003ci\u003eAnyone involved in a bar brawl will have disadvantage on attack rolls.\u003c/i\u003e","This tavern reeks of pickled fish. The owner cures them himself and sells them to travelers in sealed clay pots. \u003ci\u003eThe pots do little to mask the odor.\u003c/i\u003e","An elaborate tapestry hangs behind the bar. Rumor has it that there are secret symbols and writings embroidered into the pattern. Some say it?s a treasure map. Others say it?s magical incantations for powerful spells. And others claim it hides the password for a secret society. \u003ci\u003eThe barkeep says she just thought it was pretty.\u003c/i\u003e","A life sized statue behind the bar of a human man covering his eyes is supposedly the original owner of the tavern. Legend has it he fell in love with a Medusa and she accidentally turned him to stone. \u003ci\u003eMany spellcasters over the years have tried to reverse the condition, yet failed.\u003c/i\u003e","The proprietor of the tavern is a shifty old dwarf, always looking over his shoulder and scanning the room. Occasionally he is spotted speaking to the bar itself as he wipes down the counter top. Whenever the fire in the hearth is dying, he runs his hand over the mantle, whispers to it in a comforting manner before the entire building shudders, creaks, strains, before letting out a groaning exhale and the fire is revitalized. \u003ci\u003eSome believe the tavern itself is living.\u003c/i\u003e","An enchanted lute provides a musical accompaniment to the tavern. It has a respectable repertoire, but one string is out of tune, making concentration checks difficult. \u003ci\u003eThe tavern owner despises bards, having his paramour swept off by one. So anyone offering to retune the lute might be met with violence.\u003c/i\u003e","There is a dog. A friendly one. The unusual thing is that everyone sees the dog differently. A highlander Barbarian sees the dog as a longhaired red highland setter, but a woodelf might see the dog as a black wolfhound, and a mountain Dwarf might see it as a small rat-terrier. \u003ci\u003eThis difference is unlikely to be noticed at the time, and only comes up during conversation later, after leaving the tavern.\u003c/i\u003e","This is a saloon-style tavern with a modest stage up front where all the patrons can see. \u003ci\u003eOn Friday nights a local soothsayer sings her prophecies.\u003c/i\u003e","The tavern is associated with a local mages guild, and has magical brews on tap. Upon downing a pint, roll on wild magic table","The tavern is known for its strong drinks, occasionally a drunken reveller will come in demanding \u0027hammerbrew\u0027, which will invariably knock them out for 1d4 hours (on a DC 25 con check) \u003ci\u003eHammerbrew is incredibly expensive and the barmaid demands to be paid in advance, including tip!\u003c/i\u003e","The tavern has had enough of twitchy adventurers. All wood fittings have been burned to a blackened tone, and a large sign suggests any magic usage will lead to a ban from all establishments in the area. People are often thrown out for appearing to use magic, even if they aren?t. The tavern is that gun-shy.","The bar is staffed with retired \u0027adventurers\u0027. All are significantly mauled, scarred and most missing fingers, eyes, or limbs. Similarly battered adventurers will drink for free, in return for a tale to the general audience.","The walls are covered with hundreds of mounted heads- some unsurprising, such as a troll or a small dragon- others more so, such as a blinking, it blinked , I swear, didn?t you see it? half orc or...\u003ci\u003eis that a baby?\u003c/i\u003e","The entire tavern is curiously dusty, despite being well attended, some areas look like they have a decade of dust upon them. \u003ci\u003eIf dust is swept off an empty table, all regulars will groan, and a large number of days written in chalk on the bar will be wiped off.\u003c/i\u003e","The mugs are enchanted to refill themselves when you snap your fingers. \u003ci\u003eYou still get charged for the refills though.\u003c/i\u003e","The grounds were hallowed such that the entire area is magically silent. Patrons come from near and far for the extraordinary peace and quiet it offers. Ordering food and drink can be a bit of a hassle though, having to pantomime eating or drinking, and being brought whatever is being served that day.","A halfing sitting on a table playing a medium violin like cello. \u003ci\u003eThe Halfling is the owner, and not a very talented musician.\u003c/i\u003e","Behind the bar there\u0027s a thin-toothed comb made out of a shell, and the bartender tends to become gloomy if asked about it.","Each table and stool is a full carved piece of stonework, which slides glassily across the floor on clever grooves hidden in the floor. Given a few minutes, you can arrange every table in the place into one long feast table, with the tables making a sort of zig-zag line.","Strict No Adventurers policy - time for some Charisma checks","A friendly mastiff hound wanders around the tavern begging at tables for snuggles and scritches. \u003ci\u003eAny adventurer that feeds it a piece of meat will find that the dog will make its way outside toward a treasure chest hidden in the dirt outside.\u003c/i\u003e","This tavern has a fireplace containing a magical blue flame that radiates cold, rather than heat. This same blue flame is also behind the bar, beneath an iron grate upon which several mugs sit. This keeps them frosty cold, and makes this tavern an area favorite. \u003ci\u003eDevils like to visit here for a change of scenery.\u003c/i\u003e","This tavern is frequented by wild storytellers, who tell the truth about 25% of the time.","All patrons must check their weapons at the door of this tavern, much like a coat check. You are given a numbered ticket and the weapon is stored away in a back room behind a curtain. \u003ci\u003eUnbeknownst to the players, this tavern is notorious for ?accidentally? replacing high quality or magical weapons that have been checked with inferior duplicates.\u003c/i\u003e","All the food and drink have a slightly off taste. Not to the point of inedibility, but enough to notice something\u0027s off about it. When asked the bartender just smiles and says everything\u0027s spiced with a \"special ingredient\" here. \u003ci\u003eAn investigation will reveal the barkeep raises snails and uses their slime as a staple ingredient in all of the food. He uses the slime from his favorite snails for his regulars.\u003c/i\u003e","The ceiling of the tavern is very high up, and rather than walk around the tables servers descend from above in a complicated harness system. \u003ci\u003eSometimes, when nobody\u0027s looking, a hook will descend and pull up especially drunk patrons.\u003c/i\u003e","The owner/bartender was a merchant for many years and can\u0027t reset a good haggle. A large chalkboard behind the bar displays a list of the lowest prices customers have managed to get out of him this evening, complete with a chalk portrait of the current #1 cheapskate.","One of the servers looks a bit like a monkey, their arms dragging on the floor. On closer inspection... She is a monkey. You might not always get exactly what you ordered, but if you dare complain this monkey will show their teeth, and you really don\u0027t want to fight her.","When you come in, you\u0027re in luck: there\u0027s exactly enough seats left for your party! Turns out this tavern scales with the number of patrons in it, and is always exactly big enough to have that bustling, slightly cramped tavern feel. The servers and cooks are real however, so if too many people come in at once, you might have to wait for your meal for a bit!","Beverage faucets are fashioned to resemble a wooden snake spitting the liquid out.","One area of the bar uses oddly shaped sitting areas and tables to allow for centaurs or other non-humanoid races to be there.","Tavern secretly hides 10 coin-sized wooden emblems across it every morning. If you find one, you can exchange it for a bottom-shelf drink of your choice. Tavern\u0027s decorated enough that there are many spots for these to be hidden in. Players can find these with perception/search checks, with them being more likely to find them the earlier in the morning it is (as less of them have already been found).","The menu (or barmaid) insist on pairing everything on the menu with a spiced meat. You want ale? There\u0027s a meat for it. Wine? There\u0027s a meat for it. You just want to order some gruel and be left alone? Too bad! There\u0027s a meat for that.","Soft music fills the room, just over the din of the occupants. Each patron, however, hears a different tune/instrument to fit their mood/preference.","The wait staff are all benevolent changelings that shift a slight detail every time they leave direct sight. For example: they first meet a blonde, mustachioed barkeep. When he returns with drinks, he\u0027s clean shaven. He dips below the bar to fill from the tap and emerges with darker hair.","Upon entering you must sign up to take part in a barroom brawl. People who arrive late have to take less desirable positions in the fight, such as ?first one to get thrown through the window.?","If anyone orders anything other than the bartender?s personal brand of brew, all other patrons are allowed to throw darts at them.","A cross shaped tavern with the bar in the middle, the people always want to emerge from shadowy corners, \u003ci\u003eso this one has 8.\u003c/i\u003e","Your food/drinks are brought to you via tortoise - literally the opposite of Fast Food","Cats freely roam the Tavern looking for treats and cuddles","No chairs, we eat on the floor with low tables, prone, on your belly, propped up with your elbows.","The tavern is segregated by race, you get a discount if you sit in your designated area, charged double if you don?t","There is some strange skeleton mounted to the wall above the fireplace. Nobody knows what kind of creature it belongs to or where it came from, but it\u0027s been there for so long that patrons just accept and celebrate its existence.","The tavern is enchanted to prevent any and all acts of violence within its walls. It allows patrons to rest free from conflict or worry, no matter what their political, religious, or racial affiliation. It may also serve as the perfect hideout for someone with enemies, provided that they remain in the tavern.","Rumour has it, you are to be either stupid drunk or else heavily caffeinated while you exit through the door because otherwise crossing its threshold causes a pounding headache that plays echoes of the pounding tavern walls throughout the rest of the day intensifying and diminishing with light levels (as: Light-Sensitive).","A dwarven mechanic runs the bar and has a set of three automatons in the corner that when he presses a stone button under the bar they spring to life and start lifelessly playing a beautiful song. The bartender usually leaves it off and has a somber look whenever the tavern fills up and he puts them on.","This tavern has an ancient, but magical crossbow over the bar that has patrons split on whether or not it works or not (spoiler alert - it does), and rumors of the tavern owner\u0027s dangerous past. Bonus points if he is an elderly unassuming gentleman.","The tavern has been enchanted so that, on the inside, it seems like there\u0027s a storm raging outside no matter the weather.","A fake replica of a unique and well known artifact from the world hangs above the fireplace. Half the visitors think it?s the real thing, while the other half are certain it?s not...","The tavern is managed by a wizard and their apprentices. Unseen servants carry orders between tables while apprentices man the kegs of magically enhanced brew. \u003ci\u003eMany of the doors and passageways of the tavern may be used as portals if the proper keys and rituals are performed.\u003c/i\u003e","This tavern is known for the fire walking competition it hosts. A bed of coals is rests in the center of the tavern and is carefully tended by its staff. Those who win the competition typically get free drinks and meal for the night.","The tavern has a archery/axe throwing range in back that is often used by customers to settle bets, disputes, or just have a good time.","A long dice table makes up a section of the bar (or maybe the entire bar is a dice table, and you roll to determine the price of your drink.)","In this tavern, anyone can steal your drink without punishment.","Other patrons are playing their own ttrpg, but if inspected the party realizes that they are playing a very similar adventure to their own. \u003ci\u003eToo similar to be a coincidence.\u003c/i\u003e","A shady alchemist behind the tavern will sell sleeping potions and other concoctions for people to buy and spike drinks with. \u003ci\u003eTavern owners are aware of this man, but aren\u0027t doing anything about him due to him sharing some of his profits with them.\u003c/i\u003e","At the dartboard, there is a dart which is a +2 magic item and has been made more durable by the enchantment. It\u0027s hidden among the other darts for the tavern\u0027s dart game. \u003ci\u003eNo one else knows about it or how it got there, but it can be found with Detect Magic and stolen.\u003c/i\u003e","Drinking glasses are prismatic and more durable. It\u0027s actually a side-business the tavern has going for it, you can buy them for 1 gold per glass and will be charged for breaking them \u003ci\u003e(could have qualities other than being prismatic, point is that they\u0027re special and could make for a good souvenir)\u003c/i\u003e","The tavern is themed as a [Violent Race Single] establishment. The staff all dress up and enact stereotypes, poorly.","The tavern has lavish chandeliers, well-kept and polished countertops, high-quality alcohol and excellent entertainment inside, making it a popular hideout for the region?s nobility \u003ci\u003e(perhaps they even fund the establishment).\u003c/i\u003e","NG","NG","N","LN","LG","TITLE: The god of writing","TITLE: The goddess of
