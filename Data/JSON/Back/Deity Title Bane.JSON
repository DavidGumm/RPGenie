They bark incessantly, bite everyone, and the maids are nearly ready to quit due to all the extra cleaning necessary. In addition, the whole palace seems to smell like urine.",
                  "The Queen is a budding horticulturist and spends a lot of time gardening and trying to breed new fruits or other crops. An entire section of the Parade grounds has been turned into a vegetable garden, and the royal flower gardens are now a small orchard. The rest of the House Hold feels as though that is beneath their dignity and would love to have the Royal Gardens under the care of a ?proper? gardener and the Captain of the Royal Guard wants ?his? courtyard back.",
                  "The Princes Royal have harbored a grudge ever since they were toddlers and are always fighting. Stemming from a time when the elder brother struck the younger over the head with a wooden soldier he was playing with, they disagree on everything. The King is aging, and many wonder if the Princes will also fight over the succession\u0085",

                  "The King and Queen are both from rival houses that married to settle unrest in the Kingdom. Fortunately, they have grown fond of each other and are truly willing to let the past be the past. However their plethora of uncles, aunts, nephews, and nieces are not. It seems that early every day someone must bring up a wrong done to them in the past and seeks righting of said wrong. These petty complaints range from a hundred year old duel to the death all the way who has the rights to next weekend?s retreat in the hunting lodge (it?s really just a shack in the woods and no one really likes it, but it?s the principal of the thing).",
                  "The Queen Mother (current King?s mother) threw a party for her favored courtiers and the young princes not only refused to show up, but also insulted her parties calling them ?dry, boring, and serves terrible tea?. Many monocles were popped and many ruffs ruffled. Now the Queen Mother is lodged in her rooms and won?t come out and the young Princes are being forced to stand in the hallways holding buckets of tea at arm?s length. Everyone is in a foul mood and the servants are stepping lightly.",
                  "A noble family in a bunch of debt marries off their daughter, the dowry serving as a last resort to pay debts. Not long before marriage, the daughter?s face is disfigured on a horrible accident, and the groom to be calls the wedding off.",

The Monarch has been funding the rebels in exchange for allowing them to live a simple life after the rebellion has succeeded.",
                  "Traditionally, the heir to the throne is the current monarch?s eldest child, however the current monarch decides that they want another one of their children to become heir, instead of their eldest. The family and their advisors are split as to whether they are allowed to do this.",
                  "In a night of drunken commoner-style revelry, the prince gambled away the crown jewels at a village tavern. All he can remember about the jewels? new owner is that they were merely traveling through the kingdom and would be gone by daybreak. With each passing day, the chance of recovering the jewels lessens\u0085",

His looming return casts an ominous shadow over the new, possibly temporary queen.",
                  "To the people, it is clear that the king has no power and has been puppeteered by his council. These council members are routinely found guilty of corruption and mismanagement and tried by the people?sometimes even executed. In reality, the council holds no true power, and the king rules through his close relation to the commander of the guard. He purposefully blames the council so the people do not suspect or overthrow him.",
                  "The king is in fact no true king, however only a man so delusional that he walked right in and proclaimed himself as such. The people, being too polite, have not bothered to correct him and allow him to parade about town. No one seems willing to break the joke to the party.",
                  "The previous monarch died and left no direct heir?instead, only four rival houses each loosely related to the royal bloodline vie for power. The regency council has been too distracted to choose a true successor, for it fears the retaliation of the others if it sides with any individual.",
                  "The king believes in the justice of chance above all else. Whenever he is told of a crime, he demands that the criminal is tried in an elaborate gauntlet that effectively boils down to a coin toss?are they innocent and let free, or are they guilty and punishable by death? The people vary in their agreement with this; some will falsely report enemies in the hopes of killing them, while others refuse to report any crimes as to not carry that burden on their backs.",
                  "Having suffered a terrible accident in battle, the king has been mutilated beyond human recognition. He threatens any who dare to mention his deformity with execution but refuses to cover it.",
                  "The current king isn?t a king at all, he?s a very good lookalike who has been forced into this situation when the old King disappeared.",

                  "A special flower used in the anniversary of the Queen no longer grows and the date is coming up soon. The court haven?t told the King yet and they fear what will happen if there aren?t any of these flowers at the celebration.",
                  "The Queen is unable to bear children, a surrogate must be found but also the Queen must look as though she is pregnant to keep up appearances.",
