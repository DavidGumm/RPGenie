                                        "terrible. These two kingdoms are bitter enemies, and have engaged in open war in the past. Everyone knows it\u0027s only a matter of time before it happens again.",

                                        "abysmal. There have been failed assasination attempts by the nobility of both cities, and on more than one occasion it has resulted in open battle. Travelers from either city are barred from entering the other."
