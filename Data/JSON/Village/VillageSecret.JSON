On a very high perception check, it becomes readily apparent that there are no adolescents. Children and adults, but no one between the ages of 11 and 16. Investigation ultimately determines that during those years, the children are sent into the underdark where they are trained in languages, stealth, forgery, poisoning, disguise, and assassination.",

The moment you turn your back, the building that you were just in disappears, and is now that well down the end of the street. None of its inhabitants and objects are evil, they merely want a life without conflict, and disguising as a settlement seemed to be the best way to achieve this.",

Upon closer inspection, or being a close friend of everyone in the hamlet, they will reveal that they are a group of time travelers who ended up in the wrong time, with no way back home. As such, they decided to replicate a medieval settlement from what they?ve learned, and they?re working on a time machine in an underground lab beneath the settlement.",

But all the citizens humour this madness because he can be very generous with his gold when appeased. (Possible twist: He is a cunning trickster fey, all the gold is fools gold that will disappear outside settlement\u0027s limits).",
                                        "The settlement is famous for the entrance to a deep dungeon filled with powerful creatures. Many adventurers have gone in and not come out, and their items are added to the loot the dungeon denizens create on their own, much of which is stored in a secure treasure room. But the settlement of [Small Town Name 2], a halfling settlement several miles away also has an entrance to this dungeon. The citizens that know about it (the local Smith, the elder chief, a gnome artificer, and a pair of halfling thieves) jealously guard the secret. Because their entrance secretly goes directly to the treasure room. A hidden artificer device lets the thieves know it is safe to sneak in. What they steal goes to the Smith who markets the items to passing adventurers as his own work. Every one gets a cut of the money made. The elder looks the other way when the thieves are caught in other heists.",

The very mention of the animal?s name causes them to break out in a sweat. Mimicking the sounds they make has been known to cause bouts of screaming, fainting and hysteria. In addition, if they eat anything unknown they liken the taste to crocodile instead of chicken.",
                                        "The settlement has a hive mind, and plans to take over the world\u0085 the fact that anybody born in the settlement who leaves loses their connection to the hive and dies, as well as outsiders being not effected, is lost on the poor thing.",
                                        "The settlement?s sheriff was murdered by the citizens themselves, who are quietly anarchists that despise all authority figures. They pretend to be nice to the PCs in order to gather information about them\u0085 to make them easier to kill later if they should take on the mantle of law enforcement.",
                                        "Through a strange quirk of magic and geography, the settlement you find is actually another settlement three hundred miles to the west. Fearing the interest this might bring to their settlement, the locals attempt to discern which of the two settlements travelers are expecting, and pretend to be that settlement when in their presence.",
                                        "A god once died here, and its blood is pooled beneath the settlement. It grants them peace, good crops, and safety\u0085 but those with greedy intentions would slay every inhabitant there to possess such a treasure.",
                                        "An ancient demon came here to live out the final three years of its life and has become attached to the settlement and its people. When a rival town came to attack, the entirety of the attacking town was reported as missing.",
                                        "They?re a part of a interplanar underground railroad, for slaves trying to escape masters on other planes. A lot of Genies of the various elements keep slaves, and they plane hop to cover their tracks. This settlement is near a place where the barrier between worlds is thin. Strange happenings occur if the escaping slave is not native to the Material plane\u0085",
                                        "There is a colony of advanced elves living in the tree canopy next to this settlement. The elves observe people down below, and do social experiments on the citizens.",

                                        "It appears to be the perfect image of a quaint settlement, known for having the lowest crime rate in the region. It has even won ?Community of the Year? multiple years in a row. However, the local ?Community Watch? seems suspicious, and there are a surprising number of ?accidents? that seem to happen in the settlement, usually involving people or creatures that were seen as a threat to the quaint charm of the community.",
                                        "They once lynched a 4 year old girl for being a ?witch?. She lies buried in a well below a storage building. They were proven wrong since her death did not lift the curse, and the shame still haunts them.",
                                        "They sacrifice children to a dark power. Everyone knows it and no one talks about it. The elder selects the offers in counsel of an old wizard.",

                                        "The settlement supplies the local assassins guild. The gentle herbalist actually creates deadly toxins, the simple blacksmith has a under-the-counter line in all manner of concealed weapons and the local seamstress seems only to have cloth in various shades of black.",
                                        "They take in/consist of old extremely powerful lawbreakers that are done with that lifestyle and just want to retire and live the rest of their days in peace and quiet.",

What people don?t know is that the assistant?s job is to get the party killed, and loot their corpses to restock the shop.",
                                        "A cave nearby houses a massive hoard of gold. This belongs to a dragon, and anyone that the citizens dislike are told about the secrets that await them in this cave.",
                                        "The citizens live in total symbiotic harmony with the nearby fae, and forest, with many even being part fae from previous unions. They all have some small level in wood shaping magic, and do not use iron. They justify this to the local top-dog religion, to whom this would be very heretical, by saying the settlement is cursed and all iron disappears inside the bounds (it is merely phased into another plane and returned to you outside the city bounds).",
                                        "There is a sign outside the settlement proclaiming that murder is allowed under law. There are no guards and everyone is peaceful. That is, unless somebody breaks the law or acts too far outside of the social order. If that happens, the entire settlement will take up arms against the culprit.",
                                        "They are highwaymen who kill travelers and messed up once by killing a noble which is not so good. The noble\u0027s bodies are in a nearby cave.",
                                        "The whole settlement is actually a haunting, when the party awakens in the morning, they are in the ruins of an inn, and all the buildings in the settlement are similarly aged, with no townsfolk to be found.",

Among the stolen goods was a sentient weapon, which remembers everything and is just bursting to snitch on them. For lack of a good way to destroy and/or silence the sentient weapon, they buried it in an unmarked location out in the sheep pastures.

The wish summoned powerful spirits to build and maintain a settlement to raise the now orphaned child. The settlement is slightly quirky, even more antiquated than a normal isolated settlement, but friendly. The citizens will turn overly protective when anyone seems overly interested in the child.",
                                        "An odd quirk of displacement magic shifts the shops locations in town at random at dawn, causing the citizens to build all buildings exactly the same to be able to house all the different shop requirements.
